## Run Project Locally

In the project directory, you must run:

### `npm install`
### `cd src`
### `npm run start`

This will launch the app in the development mode, locally.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload if you make edits, and the console will also show when "realoading".\
You will also see any compilation errors in your terminal; runtime errors are available in console.
